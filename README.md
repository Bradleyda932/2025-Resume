### Welcome to my resume! I am currently a transfer senior attending Drake University, studying Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. I am hoping to expand my experience with an internship!

## ðŸ“Œ The Basics: Work Experience & Skills  
- **Work Experience:**
- 1. Village Inn (sit-down restaurant), Dishwasher, from April 2021 to ~May 2022. Worked my way to a raise after 6 months and learned almost everything within the kitchen. Quit due to low pay yet high demand.  
- 2. The Home Depot (retail), Order Fulfillment, from May 2022 to June 2023. Worked all around the store and learned many, many departments including (but not limited to): Garden, Hardware/Tools, Electrical. Quit due to poor management and moving cities.
- 3. Lowe's (retail), Hardware/Tools, from July 2023 to Present (will be leaving in May). Same story as THD, but was able to stay at the same store for almost two years straight. Leaving to pursue opportunities in my field!

- **Skills:** 
- Curious yet willing to learn: I love learning new things! This is why I knew the entire store at both retail places when I leave/left. 

- Very computer-savvy: I help whoever needs it with their problems, no questions asked. Proven to be a very good debugger at things not related to coding! Love to think about things like that, too. 

- Able to adapt easily: In one week at Lowe's, I can go from Appliances to Cashiering to Hardware to Lumber to Garden. Whatever is needed to help out!

- Team-player: Although I have never been a manager, I have learned how to manage my time at work and school well, and if I can't do something within a time period I am not afraid to ask for help or general questions (seriously, I have been told I ask too many things!)

- Competitive: Not always a bad thing, I can be very competitive when it comes to both bettering myself and doing things as quickly yet efficiently as possible. 

- Smart!: Despite taking hard classes like AP Physics I in high school and Calculus 2-3 (currently taking 4), Probability for Analytics, Machine Learning and Database Management in college, I have never had to retake any class and if I do poorly on one (hello, Computer Science II) I am always able to bounce back (hello, Machine Learning).

### Overall, I would say I am at my best when I am given a task, a time period and wiggle room for my own creations. See below for more details!

## ðŸŽ“ Ghost of Past, Present and Future...College! 
- **Past College:**

- **Current School:**

- **Future Plans:**   
  * I plan on attending the University of Nebraska-Omaha in fall 2026 to pursue a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence with no specified area of study as of now. Beyond this depends on what happens while I'm there!
