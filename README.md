# Drake University Project Showcase

## Project 1: Computer Science Capstone (R, RStudio)
For my capstone at Drake, my class was assigned real data from DMARC (Des Moines Area Religious Council) Food Pantry Network, and were tasked with figuring out many questions that a board member had for us. Those include: Why is DMARC being overrun as of late, who are these people, and where are they coming from? Our initial focus was the zip codes of visitors, but as we progressed we turned to the change in visitors overtime. We presented our project to four DMARC board members, and got very positive feedback from all of them.

> This can be found on my GitHub homepage, under the pinned repo "DMARC-Project-Deliverable".


## Project 2: Machine Learning (Python, Colab)
My first project in Machine Learning was very open-ended, with the only requirements being to choose a good dataset and a set order of when to do tasks. I had fun creating this, and chose to use College/University data, because it has always fascinated me how websites like U.S. News and Top Universities do their rankings. The results I found were surprising at first, but upon further analysis, it all made sense. (Machine_Learning_Project_1.ipynb file)


## Project 3: Cloud and Database Systems (SQL, AWS/VS Code)
Thus far in the course, we have had over a dozen labs, and one I wanted to demonstrate is Lab03: Introduction to SQL. For this, I am using an AWS Terminal (and later in the course we use VS Code) and I am tasked with creating queries by filtering specific data, using premade data courtesy of Professor Moore.

## Artificial Intelligence showcase: Generative AI Digital Portfolio 
This is a constantly updating slideshow of the ways the class uses AI in the Generative AI course. Showcased are the three platforms I use almost daily: ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Throughout this course, I have found that there are big differences between the three and how important it is to correctly prompt AI models. In addition, in class I have used: ImageFX, Dall-E, Meta AI, Stable Diffusion, MusicFX and ElevenLabs. (Digital portfolio copy.pptx file, doesn't show with LFS, requires download to open)
