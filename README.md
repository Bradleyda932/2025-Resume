# Drake University Project Showcase

> These three projects — plus an AI showcase — highlight my time at Drake. Each one received a strong grade and valuable feedback.

## Project 1: Computer Science Capstone (R, RStudio) | Grade: 98.14%  
For my capstone, our class worked with real data from DMARC (Des Moines Area Religious Council) Food Pantry Network. We were asked to answer key questions board members had, such as: Why is DMARC seeing such a surge in need? Who are the visitors, and where are they coming from? In order to accomplish this, my group performed trend analysis and found various answers — one of which is shown below:

We started by analyzing zip code patterns, then shifted toward changes in visitor counts over time. Our final results were presented to four DMARC board members — and we received positive feedback from every one of them.

## Project 2: Machine Learning (Python, Colab) | Grade: 98%  
This was my first major machine learning project, and it was intentionally open-ended — just choose a dataset and follow a defined pipeline. I picked college/university data because I’ve always been curious how sites like U.S. News come up with their rankings.

Some of the results caught me off guard at first, but after digging deeper, everything made sense.

## Project 3: Cloud and Database Systems (SQL, AWS, VS Code) | Grade: 100%  
This course was all about working with AWS, so for the final project we had creative freedom. I chose to do a lab inspired by how my professor does theirs, and recorded a walkthrough video. 

By the end of the semester, we were pretty comfortable using AWS — so this only took a few hours to complete, but I’m still proud of how it turned out.

## Artificial Intelligence Showcase: Generative AI Digital Portfolio  
This is a constantly evolving slideshow from my Generative AI class. It highlights how I use three main platforms — ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude — nearly every day. One big takeaway from this course has been how different these models are, and how much prompting style matters.

Other AI tools I’ve explored include: ImageFX, DALL·E, Meta AI, Stable Diffusion, MusicFX, and ElevenLabs.  

> Note: This portfolio is how we turn things in for class, so no specific grades are present.
