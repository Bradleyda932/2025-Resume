# Drake University Project Showcase

> These three projects and AI showcase are the highlights of my time at Drake, and all have received high graades along with valuable feedback. 

## Project 1: Computer Science Capstone (R, RStudio) | Grade: 98.14% |
For my capstone at Drake, my class was assigned real data from DMARC (Des Moines Area Religious Council) Food Pantry Network, and were tasked with figuring out many questions that a board member had for us. Those include: Why is DMARC being overrun as of late, who are these people, and where are they coming from? Our initial focus was the zip codes of visitors, but as we progressed we turned to the change in visitors overtime. We presented our project to four DMARC board members, and got very positive feedback from all of them.

## Project 2: Machine Learning (Python, Colab) | Grade: 98% |
My first project in Machine Learning was very open-ended, with the only requirements being to choose a good dataset and a set order of when to do tasks. I had fun creating this, and chose to use College/University data, because it has always fascinated me how websites like U.S. News and Top Universities do their rankings. The results I found were surprising at first, but upon further analysis, it all made sense.

## Project 3: Cloud and Database Systems (SQL, AWS/VS Code) | Grade: 100% |
In this course, we focused entirely on AWS and it's various services, so for the final project we were left to do what we wanted. I chose the option to recreate one of the professors labs, and added a five-minute video as a walkthrough. Since we have become experts at using AWS, this project took only a few hours to put together and I am very proud of the result. [Video demo](https://youtu.be/c47q4eyswJo) - 4:52 minutes

## Artificial Intelligence showcase: Generative AI Digital Portfolio 
This is a constantly updating slideshow of the ways the class uses AI in the Generative AI course. Showcased are the three platforms I use almost daily: ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Throughout this course, I have found that there are big differences between the three and how important it is to correctly prompt AI models. In addition, in class I have used: ImageFX, Dall-E, Meta AI, Stable Diffusion, MusicFX and ElevenLabs.
