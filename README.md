# Coding projects at Drake University

## Project 1: Computer Science Capstone (R, RStudio)
#### For my capstone course, my group of three was assigned data from a local non-profit organization right here in Des Moines. We are asked to clean and pull data and pick out any noticeable trends, but also to make it simple for someone with little experience to plug a small formula into the code and find anything they want. 


## Project 2: Machine Learning (Python, Colab)
#### My first project in Machine Learning was very open-ended, with the only requirements being to choose a good dataset and a set order of when to do tasks. I had fun with creating this, and chose to use College/University data, because it has always fascinated me on how websites like U.S. News and Top Universities do their rankings, and the results I found were surpsising at first, but upon further analysis it all made sense. 


## Project 3: Cloud and Database Systems (SQL, AWS/VS Code)
#### Thus far in the course we have had a dozen labs, and one I wanted to demonstrate is Lab03: Introduction to SQL. For this, we are using an AWS Terminal (and later in the course we use VS Code) and we are tasked with creating queries by filtering specific data, using premade data courtesy of Professor Moore. Below is the outline of what we need to do on a Google Doc, then is my answers. 


## Artificial Intelligence showcase: Generative AI Digital Portfolio 
#### This is a constantly-updating slideshow of the ways we use AI in the Generative AI course. Showcased are the three platforms I use almost daily: ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Throughout this course, I have found that there are big differences between the three and how much of a deal it is to correctly prompt AI models. In addition, we have used: ImageFX, Dall-e, Meta AI, Stable Diffusion, MusicFX and ElevenLabs.
